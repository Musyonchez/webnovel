Chapter 3: Choosing a Body 

After checking the information Ming Fan tried to communicate with it. 

"Hey can you hear me?" 

("Yes Master, I can hear you") 

Ming Fan hear the voice inside his head. 

This was through the contract as it could not speak yet. 

"Great meeting you we will be together from now on and be stronger together" 

("Am looking forward to it Master.") 

Generally, most beasts are intelligent as a 6- or 7-year-old kid at Black Iron and it improves as they age or advance levels. 

Mechanical beasts are more intelligent as compare to other beasts after all they have to control bodies (the shell) with a lot of complications. 

Ming Fan then left the beast taming space and summoned the mechanical bird out. 

A white circle flashed and the mechanical bird appeared. 

Different circle colors show the different levels of the beast tamer. 

They are: 

[White] - Black Iron 

[Red] - Bronze  

[Orange] - Silver 

[Yellow] - Gold 

[Green] - Platinum 

... 

After coming out then mechanical bird flattered its wings and flew onto Ming Fan's shoulder. 

"Ok let's go ... You don't have a name right should I give you one" 

("Ok master") 

"Ok let's see how about Alpha. Its powerful and you are the first." 

("I like it") 

"Ok let's go and pick your body" 

After that Ming Fan turned around and when outside the area. 

There were already some students here who have already picked their beasts. 

Somewhere on all fours, some birds, some slithering like and more 

Ming Fan guesses that they were waiting for the others to choose so he found an empty area and sat down. 

It has to be said that not everyone who came here wanted to choose a mechanical beast some just came to see if it was suitable for them. 

Others who went to other areas will also come here to check. 

This led to the students who actually contracted to be less than 10. 

Ming fan looked around and of his class there was no one here guess they went to choose other beasts. 

After a while the last person was choosing was done and the attendant appeared Infront of them. 

"Ok since your done choosing the brain let's go choose the body" 

After that he led them to the largest of the buildings next to the field. 

"Ok here is the ware house for the bodies. The beasts cannot enter in case they break something so return them and then enter" 

Listening what the attendant said they all returned the beasts to the beast taming space and then entered. 

The moment Ming Fan enter if he wasn't worried about been thrown out side, he may have let out a gasp. 

There was a saying in the previous life that said "It's so good I almost nutted" 

That was the feeling he had right now. 

All around him where mechanical exoskeletons of all shapes and sizes. 

They ranged from a meter to tens of meters. 

This was a man's wet dream. 

With his [Mechanical Heart] talent Ming Fan could see more than the other students and the more he saw the more excited he became. 

It was like a fish entering the sea. 

As he looked around to more, he grew his knowledge on Mechanics and the more ideas he had. 

Ming Fan moved from one Mechanical body to another one by one. 

Afterwards he found a place to sit and started analyzing the mechanical bodies he saw to choose one for Alpha. 

He first he disqualified the none bird type after all Alpha was a bird type Mechanical beast. 

Then he disqualified those over 10 meters. 

Mechanical beasts can only control bodies with in their energy value. 

For Black Iron mechanical beasts 10 is the limit. 

Plus, those 10 meters is for late-stage Black Iron and Alpha is only level one. 

Now with that limit Ming Fan stated to think of the intricacies from the perspective of the [Mechanical Heart]. 

One by one he removed then like the ones with clear problems, the ones with poor design, poor building and so on. 

Finally, he landed on two. 

One was 7 meters and can be said to be the best all a round of the ones here. 

The other was 3 meters it's had a couple of issues but its design and machining were the best. 

After thinking about it he chose the second one. 

With his second talent [Infinite copy: Natural Items] he can rebuild it better and it will help him improve his machinery skills. 

Remember that Ming Fan's Machinery skill are from high school studies and the common network. 

If he can disassemble it and study it, he can improve immensely. 

After making his choice he walked up to the attendant this time he did not have to wait for the others the attendant nodded. 

Then the attendant called out to another. 

"He picked B7856 help him with the rest of the procedures" 

"Ok sir. Follow me." 

After that he walked forward and Ming Fan followed. 

They walked to the front of the Mechanical body and then he waved his hand and it disappeared. 

Ming Fan was not surprised by this after all he knew this world had storage rings, he had seen his teachers use them. 

Then the attendant lead Ming Fan out of the warehouse building to another smaller but relatively large one. 

When Ming Fan entered this building were not Mechanical bodies but a long corridor with rooms on both sides. 

The attendant lead Ming Fan while looking at the doors the rooms for an empty one. 

The ones with a red glow were occupied. 

Finally, they came to a room with a green glow and pushed a button to open the door. 

After entering Ming Fan noticed it looked like a laboratory but with everything bigger, a table in the middle with restrains and cranes for lifting things. 

"Ok I will help you change the beast's brain to this body you should watch you may need to do it later." 

Ming Fan had no objection he was intending to watch any way. 

The Attendant walked to the center of the room and waved his hand and the 3-meter mechanical body appeared on the laboratory table. 

After which he tapped his hands in the air and a display appeared. 

Seen this Ming Fan could not help but think of Iron Man. 

Manipulating the display in the air mechanical hands appeared on the table and started to move together with the cranes. 

Skillfully he operated them to open up the chest cavity layer by layer. 

"Now place you beast on the table next to the body" 

"Ok" 

Ming Fan nodded and summoned Alpha. 

When he appeared, Alpha was a little confused of where he was and looked around curiously. 

"Alpha we will move your brain to the big body over there ok?" 

Alpha looked at the big body on the table and then nodded. 

Ming Fan then carried him next to huge body and let him down on the table and instructed him not to move. 

The attendant the skillfully operated the hands and to open up Alpha's chest and remove a rectangular piece of metal and placed it on the big bird body. 

After which he closed the chest the same way he opened it just on reverse. 

"Ok it's done. It cannot move on the table to avoid breaking things." 

"Return it to the beast taming space to see its actions." 

Ming Fan nodded and the returned Alpha to the beast taming space then looked inside. 

As soon as Alpha went back, he tried moving his body. 

With the initial jerkiness until it was moving skillfully. 

Ming Fan then opened the beast information. 

[Name:] Alpha 

[Attribute:] Mechanical 

[Potential:] Silver 

[Level:] Black Iron 1 

[Skills:] Flying, Grabbing, Pecking, Fire breath, Fire Talons, Fire wings. 

Ming Fan noticed two skills where added which should be from the new Mechanical body. 

[Fire breath] 

[Breath a flame from the mouth] 

[Fire Talons] 

[Ignite the talons to burn during grabbing] 

[Fire Wings] 

[Ignite the wings during a fight] 

Seen this skilled although they were very common Ming Fan was satisfied after all normally, they the beasts from the breeding base have only one or two skills. 

After leaving the beast taming space Ming Fan said thank you to the attendant and was led out. 

Returning to the entrance of the Mechanical area the attendant wished Ming Fan success in his beast taming and then turned around and returned.  

Seen this Ming fan returned to the entrance of the breeding base and found students standing there but no one summoned their beasts. 

Even though he did not know why he just found his classmates and started chatting with them. 

Ming Fan is the sought of person who when in a group just goes along coupled with his ordinary face he is easily overshadowed.
