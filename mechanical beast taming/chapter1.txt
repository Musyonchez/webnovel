Chapter 1: Awakening 

"Did you hear someone in class 3 awakened a SS level talent" 

"Yeah, I am really envious. I wish it was me." 

"What are you talking about even I another life it would never be you" 

In a gymnasium a group of students in a line where talking. 

One of then near the back was in a daze thinking of something. 

His name was Ming Fan and he was a transmigrator. 

He transmigrated to a boy with the same name. 

His previous world was called Blue star and he had transmigrated for three years. 

As an avid reader of web novels this was the best thing that has ever happened to him after all there are super powers in this world. 

In this world there where extraordinary powers that allowed people to make contracts with beasts. 

Now was the awakening ceremony that happened when one was 16 years old. 

At the front of the line was a podium that was used to help awaken talents and the beast taming space. 

Talents were divided into 9 levels from bottom to top F, E, D, C, B, A, S, SS, SSS. 

The higher the level the more powerful it is. 

Whether it is the size of the beast taming space and its help with helping the beast grow or help in fighting or favorability to the beasts. 

But not everyone can awaken their beast taming space. 

It is said that in the early stage of awakening less than 5% of the population could awaken but now it's more than 70% 

Ming Fan was not particularly worried after all he is a transmigrator. 

As the line moved along Ming Fan was getting more anxious thinking of the type of talent that he is going to awaken. 

"Next" 

Finally, it was Ming Fan turn he walked up to the podium and put his hand on the crystal on the podium. 

Ming Fan felt a cool felling pass through his hand and circle his body then leave and return back to the crystal. 

At this moment Ming Fan felt as if something was inside him and a lot of information appeared in his head. 

It involved his awakened talent. 

He actually had two but it was not a surprise because he had two souls.  

His and for the original host of this body. 

[Mechanical Heart: SSS] 

[Infinite copy: Natural Items: SSS] 

Ming Fan was shocked that both of them where SSS level but not too much after all he is a traverser he cannot be trash. 

With excitement he was about to check what they were about but Ming Fan heard to dissatisfaction of the people behind him. 

He had no choice but to release his had from the crystal turn his attention to the teacher beside him. 

"What is your talent and level" 

In the federation one had to register his talent after awakening.  

It was mostly to better provided resources. 

"I awakened a S level talent called Mechanical Heart" 

Hearing this the teacher was a little excited but still managed to control herself after all there where students around but the students below where another story. 

"What did I hear Ming Fan actually awakened a S level talent" 

"Damn, why wasn't it me" 

"Hey, do you need a little brother" 

"I will have a monkey for you" 

It was understandable after all in an enter awakening the school may only have 2 or 3 S level talents.  

SS level years may go by without a single one while SSS level one may fail to appear in decades. 

This is also the reason why Ming Fan choose to hide in SSS level talents. 

After all a tall tree in the forest gets destroyed by the wind but also showing a S level talent so as to get better resources 

"Ok recorded you can move on Next" 

After that Ming Fan turned a deaf ear to the people around him and left school going home. 

A hundred of years ago spiritual energy appeared in this world. Then beasts, plants and other objects started to mutated and bore spirituality. 

Gates also started to appear and monsters and other creatures came through attacked. 

That was the darkest time for humanity but then someone discovered the ability to tame beasts and so beast tamers where born. 

Then they formed a counter attack against beasts clearing an area for humans to live. 

They formed cities to defend against the beasts while expanding. 

You would ask after so long why have they never defeated too beasts. 

One after the spiritual energy awakening the world expanded drastically. 

They current world is much larger than before no one really knows by how much. 

Just that it is very large and humans just occupy a corner. 

Second in a fight of that level only the top powerhouses matter and humanity has too few as compared with the monsters. 

The formation of cities as continued since and now they are a lot of them. 

The city that Ming Fan is in is called Baishi city. 

The city is divided into 7 rings.  

From inner to outer the less prosperous it is. 

One of the reasons is that in case of a beast tide the outer areas become a buffer. 

He lives in the 5th ring. 

And this is because his parents where beast tamers and bought a house there but died a month before he transmigrated in a beast tide. 

This is what cause the original host to go into depression and die. 

After all been 13 and losing both your parents is had but also for the plot after all not having parents is one of the protagonist templates. 

The school he goes to is in the same ring after all the inner the ring the more the fees. 

But because of the federation policy towards orphans or the needy he goes for free and his good grades. 

Otherwise, he would go to a school in the sixth ring. 

The seventh ring or matter of fact the outer most ring of any city is a military zone and is restricted to civilians and none beast tamers. 

After walking for almost 45 minutes, he reached his house. 

It was a three bedroom stand alone. 

Entering the house he hurriedly sat down on the couch in the sitting room and viewed in talents first. 

[Mechanical Heart - SSS] 

[Infinite copy: Natural Items: SSS] 

After a while he understood them. 

The first one [Mechanical Heart - SSS] grants him a high affinity and understanding with mechanical beasts  

The second one [Infinite copy: Natural Items: SSS] allows him to infinitely copy natural items. 

They were both powerful one after the other. 

He was very satisfied with them. 

What was left was to awaken his beast taming space and then got to the pet breeding base to contract a pet. 

He adjusted his mood and tried to feel it. 

This is a very had thing to do but after the crystal on the podium helped him awaken his talent it can be considered having done 99%vof the work. 

Less than a minute later Ming Fan felt his mind been drawn to a white space. 

The space was about 200 meters long, wide and high. 

This surprised Ming Fan but just for a moment. 

A new F level beast taming space is about 10 meters long, wide and high and a new SSS level is 100. 

With two SSS level talents its normal to have 200 meters right. 

"...." 

The space was empty so quickly lost interest and left. 

Returning back to his body he made a meal for dinner with consisted of rice and some vegetables. 

After all he has to save for taking care of the contracted beast after it levels up, he will have more money to spend. 

After eating he opened his computer and surfed to network to check for information about mechanical beasts. 

Even though they are taught in school he still wants to get more in-depth after all in school it is broad covering the entire system of beasts. 

Even though the information was not really that deep after all its the common network even none beast tamers can check it. 

With his SSS level talent [Mechanical Heart] it's like a fish in water just these common things gave him a lot of inspiration. 

Ming Fan was caught up and could not extradite himself. 

After reading till late he went to bed waiting for tomorrow.
