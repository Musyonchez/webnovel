Chapter 2: Printing money print

Knocking at the door mr. Odecho openned it to see the principal sitted on the other side of the desk.

He was a middle aged bald man who was slightly fat.

In front of him sat a girl in the same school uniform as John Mutua.

John Mutua geussed that this was the girl who awkaned the S level talent in class 1.

Before the principal could ask mr. Odecho said

"He has also awakened a S level talent"

Hearing this the principal was actually surprised as in their no. 7 high school which is near the bottom having 1 S level is great let alone two.

"Ok, thank you you can leave we will discuss later"

Seen this the class teacher did not object and calmy clossed the door as he left.

He knew tha there would be a big bonus for a S level talent in his class.

"Ok have a sit, what was your name again?"

Hearing this John Mutua took the remaining sit next to the girl while saying his name.

"Yes John, just like i was telling Mary here first congratulations on awakening a S level talent and second the school will give you a 500,000 startup capital"

Hearing this John Mutua nodded but was happy inside.

You have to know that he is of the orphan template and the little saving left are almost used up.

The levels in this world are black Iron, bronze, silver,gold,platinum,amethyst,diamond,king,emperor,star,moon,sun.

This is common knowledge in the internet.

The corpse of a black iron beast starts at 10,000 while that of a bronze 100,000 obviusly not that rigid but you get the idea.

So 500,000 is alot of money for him know but there is something more important.

"Principal i was hopping you could exhange for me low grade spirit stones."

Spirit stones are a by product of spirit enegry revial.

That are a concentrated forms of energy.

In high levels the use of normal money is not used either sprit stones or barter.

In for the sake of his first talent he has to have a physical thing to copy after all the 500,000 is virtual currency.

Looking at John Mutua closely the principal did not ask why and direcly agrred.

In this world spied on other people secrets rushly can lead to huge misunderstanigs and offending a S level geniuss for spirit stones is not wise.

After all the principal is only a B levl talent.

"Ok according to the market price its a 1 for 100,000 dollars."

The official price of a spirit stone is 1:100,000 but it is almost impossible to exchnage atthat price mostly at 120,000 or 130,000.

Official organizations like schools are one of the only places where you can exchange at the official price tha why John mutua asked.

After saying that the principal chatted with the two until a teacher came in with the awakening stone signilling that the awakening ceremony was over.

"Ok since you two are the only S level talents he are two space rings from the school, Mary your money will be send to your phone and John your is in the ring."

Space rings are items that have a much larger internal space.

For example the space rings given by the principal have a internal space of about 1 meter and one cannot store none living things.

Taking a space ring each they bid fare well to the principal and left the office with out talking to her John Mutua walked out towards the school gate heading home resolutly.

John Mutua was really not in the habit of chatting with others even in the principlas office he was doing of the lisening than talking.

John lives in a appertment in a relatively good part of the city.

The parents of the original were both bronze level beast tamers hence why they could afford.

Opening the door the appartment was a 2 bedroom flat relativly large.

John Mutua threw his backpack next to the door and directly sat on the coach holding the space ring in his hand.

Place it on his finger he sent spirit energy tot he ring and he could see a space of about 1m inside with 5 low grade spirit stones inside.

Spirit stones are divided into grades depenging on several factore such as the purity of the stone, amount of sprital enegry, ...

That is low grade spirit stone, middle grade spirit stone, high grade spirit stone and top grade spirit stone.

To actuvate a space ring one needs spiritual energy but before awakening and opening the beast taming space one has none.

With a thought of his mind he took out a low grade spirit stone and then put it back.

This was a intresting feeling so he did this several times before he stopped.

Getting serious he held one in his and concentrated in activating his first talent.

This is the reason why he did not what virtual currency.

When one awakens his/her talent just like knowing it's function activating it is also jus like insctict.

Like a baby drinking milk.

So in hand two low grade spirit stones appeared.

They did not look identical because while he was copying it he had a feeling that he could change small things about it.

He could not turn it into a middle grade spirit stone or change the purity but he could change the apperance slightly.

This also caused a stone in his heart to drop because if you copy allot of things it is easy for others to realize they are duplicates.

But since he could alter them he didn't have that much to worry about even if the purity and amount of spirit energy where consisnt.

Maybe the mine they came from was like that who knows.

So John started copying spirit stones like a printer but at arround the tenth time he realzed it was too slow even though he could copy one in just under a second it was still slow.

So he thought of copying multiple so he held 3 in his and and tried to copy.

Surprisinly it actually copied which surprised his but not for long a joy welled up in his heart.

Then he tried thinking of was to maximize this.

Fisrt one was to stuff his hand but that was inefficint then he thought of placing one in each gap of his fingers and on his palm that way he could hold like 17 which was impressive.

A spirit stone is not that large, it is slightly smalller than a gold ball.

Then he thought of the back of his hand and after a test he found that he could copy from that too.

Thinking up to here what about his arms or his whole body if he could do this then his money printing would be upgraded to another level.

Sadly if wishes were horses all begers would ride and it did not work.

It seems it is only applicable to after the wrist to the fingers.

Going back to the fingers, palm and the back of the hand John Mutua thought for a moment then went to the bathroom and came out with two buckets.

Placing all the spirit stones he had copied so far in one bucket he wedged his hand in and started copying.

The new spirt stones would push the ones on top making them fall on the floor and then the new ones after that did the same.

John Mutua now felt like he had found a cheat code.

So he collect the ones that felt and filed the second bucket then with two hands in a bucket his money printing directly took off.

After about 6 hours he stopped not because he was tired of printing money (NEVER) but according to hi culculations the amount now was just enough to fit his space ring.

See withe the bucket method he can copy 25 spirit stones with one hand per second two is 50.

His space ring it 1 meter by 1 meter by 1 meter that is 100 cm all sides.

A spirit stone though not cubed is roughly 1 cm in diameter so his space ring can pack 1 millon spirit stones.

Now 1 million spirit stones divided by 50 is 20,000 that is 20,000 per second and 333.333 minutes and 5.55 hours.

Straightening his sore back he looked at the piles of spirit stones but did not feel even the slightest pain just joy.

Packing all of them into the spacering he looked around only packed one bag of clothes.

Then he took one last look at his house and then resolutely closed the door and left hailing a taxi.
