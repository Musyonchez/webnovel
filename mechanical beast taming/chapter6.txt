Chapter 6: New body

After making up his mind he did not rush to summon Alpha but opened his phone and when to went to the Beast tamer mall.

This time he bought a large mechanical forge, one each type of natural item of tier 1 and a large assembly integration bay.

Tier 1 items are mostly used by Black Iron.

Above which is tier 2, tier 3 and so on.

Alpha can at most used tier 2 items but not effectively so he did not buy them for now.

After making the purchase he moved closer to the door summoned Alpha.

It has to be said that Alpha has been promoted to level three during time.

The speed may seem fast but remember that Ming Fan is a double SSS talent beast tamer and Alpha absorbs spirit stones like they are water

After asking Alpha to keep alert for any movement near the door Ming Fan yawned and lay next to Alpha and slept.

Hearing Alpha talking to him Ming Fan woke up, returned Alpha to the beast taming space and walked towards the door.

Opening the door while looking at his watch he realized he had slept for 5 hours.

Outside the door was a drone with a box.

Having done this before Ming Fan skillfully opened the box scanned the rings inside went into the warehouse emptied the contents packed 50000 middle grade spirit stones into a low-grade space ring and place then the box which scanned and closed.

Returning outside he placed the box back on the drone and it flew away.

After seeing it off Ming Fan went back and looked at the things spread on the floor and called more that 50 robots to come and manage them.

They were built by Ming Fan himself as for the original 10 he scrapped them.

He is afraid of been spied on by the robots after all he has a lot of secrets.

This time from the price tag 70,000 spirit stones you can see how much things Ming Fan bought.

It too several hours to finally clear.

He did not disassemble the small mechanical forge but left it where it is while placing the large one in the middle of the ware house.

The tier 1 materials were arranged together in special controlled shelves with the others he had bought earlier.

As for the assembly bay it was brought forward after the forge and connected to it by conveyor belts suspended from the ceiling.

After he was done, he did not was to operate on Alpha while sleep deprived which may cause errors so he simple came to Alpha and lay on him sleeping.

One boy and one mechanical bird stayed there for the whole night.

Occasionally Alpha would use his [Fire wings] to warm Ming Fan to prevent him from freezing.

The next Morning after waking up Ming Fan went to the design hub and drew up a small mechanical bird for Alpha while he working on his main body because he left the original one in the breeding base.

After all it was theirs.

With Ming Fan current level of mechanics, it is easy to design it and even Alpha joined in on the specifications.

When he was done, he simulated the design for obvious errors and the sent it to the small forge.

He then went over and sent the parts to the assembly bay.

Then asked the robots to send the parts to the table.

Using the on-air display and the hands on the side of the table he quickly connected the parts skillfully.

What came out was a machinal bird body about half a meter tall with no combat power but a lot of auxiliary things.

With skills such as microscope eyes, laser eyes, sharp wings, sharp talons, fire talons.

After that Alpha lay on the table Ming Fan extracted his brain and transplanted it on the small bird.

A skill panel would be

[Name:] Alpha

[Race:] Mechanical Bird

[Attribute:] Mechanical

[Potential:] Silver

[Level:] Black Iron 3

[Skills:] Microscope eyes, laser eyes, sharp wings, sharp talons, fire talons, holographic projector, multi-spectral scanners ...

The current Alpha was also added with a chip that Ming Fan bought for 500 middle grade stones that contains most of the knowledge on the beast tamer Network.

In most areas Alpha is smarter than Ming Fen right now.

After that Ming Fan started on studying Alpha's main body mostly the technique used.

Before Ming Fan could only see it was extraordinary but now it is still extraordinary but he can understand it.

After a day of studying the body Ming Fan went to the design hub and started to restructure the body.

With the help of the walking encyclopedia which is Alpha the redesign was much more efficient and faster than Ming Fan thought.

Ming fan incorporated a lot of other fields and did a lot of experiments.

After all, with his copy ability he can afford the expense.

With the help of the forge Ming Fan could test part and keep redesigning them until he was satisfied.

In three days, it was done.

Looking at the mechanical bird on the screen that was running simulations both Ming Fan and Alpha where satisfied.

With the Infinite Copy he used to the maximum.

Not only was the current alpha armed to the tee the whole body was made of special tier one materials to the maximum.

Alpha Also reached level 4 during this time.

After it was done Ming Fan went to the large forge but first started copying the materials needed in the manufacturing.

It took a while but when it was done, he started making the parts.

Putting them together took a while because it was more complex but with the walking Encyclopedia, he was able to finish without any major problems.

The end product was an 8-meter-tall bird with three legs and a long neck.

For this creation Ming Fan did not go crazy but worked on the fundamentals after all this was his first full mechanical creation.

Alot of attention was added like:

1. Reinforced Talons and Beak: The talons and beak are forged from an ultra-dense alloy, combining titanium and advanced carbon composites, making them nearly indestructible and capable of cutting through the toughest materials.

2. Feather Material: The feathers, crafted from a graphite-based nano material, not only offer exceptional strength and lightness but are also highly flexible, allowing the bird to execute sharp aerial maneuvers with precision.

3. Elemental Breath: Its multi-element breath system is powered by internal energy cores and a lot of natural items of each system, allowing it to switch between fire, ice, poison, water, wind, and lightning at will, each controlled by separate nozzles for targeted attacks or utility.

4. Gatling Guns: The four back-mounted gatling guns are equipped with auto-reloading mechanisms, utilizing advanced stabilization systems for accuracy in mid-flight. The explosive bullets can be set to different fuses, enabling delayed detonations.

5. Tail Feather Shield: The expanding tail feathers form a dense, interlocking shield, capable of withstanding high-caliber attacks and absorbing shock waves, while their reflective surface can deflect energy-based weaponry.

6. Engine Boosters: The micro-thrusters on its body and under its wings are powered by a hybrid propulsion system, providing both silent hover capabilities and extreme speed bursts, making it highly agile in combat and evasive maneuvers.

Looking at what could be considered a giant in front him Ming Fan and Alpha were very satisfied.

Alpha was circling around his improved body and although it was a mechanical system Ming Fan could still feel its excitement through the contract.

"Ok, come down to the table I will do the change"

("Yes master")

After landing on the table Ming Fan used the displays to control the hands on the table to open both Alpha and the new body chests, remove Alpha's brain and then transplanted it then closes them up.

Ming Fan did not dare let Alpha stand up as not to break anything but instead summoned him back to the beast taming space.

Looking inside the space Ming Fan could see Alpha flying around trying to get the hang of the new body.

Ming Fan did not disturb Alpha but simply left the space and walked out of the Warehouse he needed to contact testing and training to allow Alpha to easier control the new body at the same time.
