ok but i think i will lock it for now and have it come into play when beasts reach a higher level

next is to file in others i will use the below list you gave me at the start as a guide

Worldbuilding (how beast taming works, ecosystems, etc.)

there are 9 levels of talents and 12 levels of the initial power levels namely
blackiron, bronze, silver, gold, platinum, amethyst, diamond, king, empoer,star, moon and sun

every level up your can contract a new beast but the protagonist has two souls in one body so he can have two per level a total of 14

Beast system (types, evolution paths, rarity, powers)

types are the usual like biolgical elemntal mechanical spiritual etc 

the protagonist because of his set master talent will choose the chess set which has 16 pieces.

the chess sect can be considered as a complite form that is it has no evelution form. 
not that this will make it powerful but just like say elemntal beasts like a fire elemntal unless it goes for the path of mutation it will have a complete  form that is pure lemntal beast

Taming methods (contracts, items, rituals)
contracts have been explained as for items for the intial beast taminng i will not have weapons but will be added later as the tamers them selves become power ful and the beasts begin to change to human forms

Protagonist (background, abilities, goals)
for the protagonist they will just go with the flow to be more powerful while the background is obviously the orphan template

Power scaling (how beasts or tamers grow stronger)
how they grow is to break through level.
each major level has 9 smaller like bronce 1, bronze2, ..., bronze9, silver1 etc
as for how they actually become more power full there is first potential that is a gold potential beast will be easier to breakkthrough to gold as compared to a silver potention
there is cross level breakthrough due to opportunities like a silver beasts gets to gold but it potentiol is still silver, there is evolution. As for the normal upgrade it mostly energy like consuming high energy things and fighting etc

Naming (beasts, abilities, locations, factions)
i always have a problem in naming in chinise so i will use by tribal names in kenya like the kamba

Plot structure (arcs, conflicts, twists)
just think of them as time goes on or as needed

did i miss something
