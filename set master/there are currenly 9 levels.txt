there are currenly 9 levels of talent F,E,D,C,B,A,S,SS,SSS
i will give him two SSS talents with updgareds to SR and SSR and SSSR and then a characteristic
the R kinda of means SSS it is to shorten

the two talents are Set Master and Point Enhancer

lets start with the Set Master it it a talent that for the base it increases 100% of every thing about the beasts on the number of tamed beasts
for example if one has 2 beasts they will have a power up of 200% and 3 is 300% etc
second thing is level matching all beasts in the set have matching levels if one updgrades all updgrade
third thing is energy sharing the beasts in the set plus the protagonist form a feed back loop allowing energy for spell, attack, defense etc to be shared by all.

now what i had a problem with was i wanted for talents below SS level to only have one thing that their talennt does. This thing becomes stroger until S level and from then on for every S level to add a ability.

thought i did not have all three abilities for the set Master but turns out i do

so next is the Point enhancer

now for the point enhancer this talent can convert items into points which can be used to enhace things mostly in the panel of the beast

first ability add points to skills to improve them
second add points to talents to improve them (Note talents for the beasts are not as comprihensive as thoose of tamers or may be be in the early stage its things like fire talent, ice talent, defense, strength, poison, illusion etc your can add more your self)

now the problem if the third thing am thinking of laws like you know the law of fire, the law of water, the law of the five elements, the law of samsara, the law of life etc but it is too advanced and cannot be used in the early stage so am thinking of having it in at SR or SSR so i need something to use as my third ability for the talent.  
What do you have
