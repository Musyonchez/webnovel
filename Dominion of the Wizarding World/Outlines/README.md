# Chapter Outlines

This folder contains detailed scene-by-scene breakdowns for each chapter.

## Outline Format
Each outline includes:
- **Chapter Goal** - What the chapter accomplishes
- **Scene Breakdown** - 4-6 scenes with word count targets
- **Key Themes** - Important elements to emphasize
- **Character Development** - How MC and others grow
- **Plot Advancement** - Story progression points

## Current Outlines
- **Chapter_1_Outline.txt** - COMPLETE (used for finished Chapter 1)

## Planning Process
1. Author defines major beats and character moments
2. Outline created with scene-by-scene structure
3. Word count targets set (2,400-2,600 words per chapter)
4. Key dialogue and plot points identified
5. Outline used as blueprint for chapter writing

## Writing Guidelines from Chapter 1
- MC refers to AI as "chip" not "AI"
- Chip communications in brackets [LIKE THIS]
- Show MC's analytical nature vs emotional responses
- Keep worldbuilding subtle - no info dumps
- Focus on practical consequences of actions
- Maintain dark, survival-focused tone

## Chapter Structure Template
- 5-6 scenes per chapter
- 400-600 words per scene
- Clear beginning/middle/end for each chapter
- End with hook or progression milestone
- Balance action, character development, and plot advancement

## Consistency Notes
- MC is 11 years old, acts mature due to transmigration
- Father is Baron Aldric Malaroth (High Knight)
- Setting: Kingdom of Ashenwald
- No wizard knowledge yet - MC only knows knight world
- Chip helps with optimization but has limits
