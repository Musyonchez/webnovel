CHAPTER 2 OUTLINE - Dominion of the Wizarding World

CHAPTER GOAL: Introduction to knight vitality system and advanced training path

SCENE 1: DEMONSTRATION AND EVALUATION [800-1000 words]
- MC meets father in private training ground
- Father says Sir Garrett reported MC has mastered all 12 stances
- MC demonstrates the stances for father
- Father surprised/happy: average person takes 1-2 months, 1 week is exceptional

SCENE 2: VITALITY DEMONSTRATION [1000-1200 words]
- Father explains two pillars of knighthood: combat techniques + breathing methods
- Father picks wooden training sword from rack, tests weight
- Father demonstrates vitality projection: strikes down, MC tells chip to record
- Wave projection hits dummy, severs it in two
- Wooden sword crumbles from vitality overload
- MC amazed by raw power display

SCENE 3: KNIGHT SYSTEM EXPLANATION [800-1000 words]
- Father explains vitality = life force projection every knight has
- Must open "seed of life" in abdomen through breathing techniques
- Knight ranks: Apprentice → Low → Intermediate → High → Grand → Legendary
- Breathing methods grow the seed, combat techniques apply vitality in battle
- MC tells chip to categorize energy as "vitality" from now on
- MC wonders about power when vitality combines with combat techniques

SCENE 4: THE RISKY PROPOSITION [600-800 words]
- Normal path: basic stances → breathing methods → slow seed opening → Low Knight
- Apprentice knights: in process, can strengthen body but can't project
- Father offers fast track: "blow the door off" with external help instead of slow opening
- Very risky: could result in maiming or death
- Father's internal conflict: exceptional potential vs extreme danger
- MC accepts (internal thought: chip + transmigrator = main character confidence)

TOTAL TARGET: ~2,200-2,600 words

KEY THEMES:
- Introduction to vitality/life force system
- Father recognizes MC's exceptional talent
- High-risk, high-reward choice
- MC's confidence from transmigrator knowledge
