Chapter 3: Secrets in the Shadows

Three days had passed since his father's demonstration of vitality, and Morvain found himself summoned to a place he had always avoided as a child—the Marquis's private study. The very thought of entering that room made his borrowed memories recoil with an inexplicable sense of dread.

"Follow me," Aldric commanded, his tone brooking no argument as he led Morvain through the castle's winding corridors.

The study was located in the oldest part of the castle, where the stones seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. As they approached the heavy oak door, Morvain felt a familiar chill creep down his spine—the same sensation the original Morvain had experienced whenever he ventured near this forbidden space.

Aldric placed his hand on the door's iron handle and paused, glancing back at his son. "What I'm about to show you must never leave this room. Do you understand?"

"Yes, Father."

The door swung open with a low groan, revealing a chamber that seemed to exist outside the normal flow of the castle. Heavy tapestries covered the walls, their dark fabric depicting scenes of battle and conquest that seemed to move in the flickering candlelight. Shelves lined with ancient tomes stretched from floor to ceiling, and the air itself felt thick with age and secrets.

But it was something else that made Morvain's skin crawl—the unmistakable sensation of being watched. Not by human eyes, but by something far more primal and ancient. The feeling pressed against his consciousness like a weight, making every instinct scream that he didn't belong here.

"Chip, scan the room for any anomalous readings," he thought quietly.

His father moved through the study with practiced ease, seemingly unaffected by whatever presence lurked in the shadows. But Morvain noticed something else now—the way Aldric moved wasn't entirely human. There was a fluidity to his movements, a predatory grace that spoke of something beyond normal mortal limitations.

The vitality training had changed his father, Morvain realized. Years of cultivating that life force had transformed him into something more than an ordinary man, and the study seemed to respond to that transformation with recognition rather than hostility.

Aldric approached what appeared to be a solid stone wall near the back of the chamber. His fingers traced along the mortar lines with careful precision until they found what they were seeking—a hidden lever disguised as part of the stonework.

With a soft click, a section of the wall swung inward, revealing a concealed compartment barely large enough to hold a man's outstretched arms. Within the hidden space, five books rested on individual pedestals, each one bound in different materials—leather, metal, what looked like scales, and substances Morvain couldn't immediately identify.

"These," Aldric said with reverence, "are the accumulated breathing methods of House Malaroth. Collected over generations, traded for, won in battle, or taken from the corpses of our enemies."

He reached for the central tome, its binding a deep crimson that seemed to pulse with its own inner light. "This is our family's primary inheritance—the Malaroth Knight Breathing Technique."

Morvain studied the book as his father lifted it carefully from its resting place. The cover bore no title, only a symbol that matched their house crest—the mirrored M that had become synonymous with plague and persistence.

"Unfortunately," Aldric continued, his voice carrying a note of frustration, "this method is incomplete. We lost portions of it during the Crimson Wars three generations ago, when our ancestral library burned." He handed the book to Morvain with careful ceremony. "But what remains is still formidable."

"How formidable?" Morvain asked, accepting the tome with both hands. The book felt heavier than its size suggested, as if the knowledge within carried physical weight.

"Breathing methods are ranked in four tiers," his father explained. "Low, Middle, High, and Top. Most noble houses possess Middle-tier methods at best. A few of the great houses have access to High-tier techniques." Aldric's expression grew proud. "This is a High-tier method, despite its incomplete state."

Morvain felt the significance of what he held. Even damaged, this book represented power that most knights could only dream of accessing.

"Study it carefully," Aldric instructed, his tone growing stern. "Understand every word, every breathing pattern, every visualization technique described within. Tomorrow, I depart to acquire the materials you'll need to begin practicing this method using the accelerated approach we discussed."

The Marquis fixed his son with an intense stare. "Three rules: First, you will master every detail before I return. Second, you will return this book to this chamber before leaving—it never leaves this room under any circumstances. Third, you will speak of this to no one. The existence of our family's methods is a secret that has kept us alive for generations."

"I understand, Father."

Aldric nodded once, then strode from the study, leaving Morvain alone with the ancient tome and whatever unseen presence continued to observe from the shadows.

The moment his father's footsteps faded, Morvain opened the book and addressed his most reliable ally.

"Chip, scan and record everything in this book. Full analysis and pattern recognition."

[SCANNING INITIATED - PRIORITY OVERRIDE ENGAGED]

The pages felt thick and substantial under his fingers as he began flipping through them rapidly. Each page contained dense text written in archaic script, accompanied by detailed diagrams showing breathing patterns, body positions, and what appeared to be energy flow charts depicting how vitality should circulate through the human form.

[SCAN PROGRESS: 23%... 47%... 68%... 89%... COMPLETE]
[PROCESSING COLLECTED DATA...]

Morvain continued turning pages while the chip worked, maintaining the appearance of rapid scanning while actually allowing his technological advantage to do the heavy lifting.

[ANALYSIS COMPLETE]

[SECONDARY FUNCTION: ENERGY CONCENTRATION AND STORAGE IN ABDOMINAL REGION]
[TERTIARY FUNCTION: CONTROLLED ENERGY RELEASE FOR PHYSICAL ENHANCEMENT]
[COMPLETION STATUS: 82% INTACT - MISSING ADVANCED CIRCULATION PATTERNS]

"Can you extrapolate the missing portions?" Morvain asked silently.

[INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR RELIABLE EXTRAPOLATION]
[ADDITIONAL COMPARATIVE METHODS REQUIRED]
[RECOMMENDATION: ACQUIRE SUPPLEMENTARY TECHNIQUES FOR ANALYSIS]

"Save everything to my memory partition and maintain active access."

[ACKNOWLEDGED - TRANSFERRING TO LONG-TERM STORAGE]
[REAL-TIME ACCESS ENABLED]

Now came the delicate part. Morvain suspected he wasn't truly alone in this study, and maintaining the illusion of normal study behavior was crucial. He returned to the beginning of the book and began reading through it again, this time at a normal pace.

He moved his head naturally as his eyes tracked across each line, occasionally pausing to reread sections or study the diagrams more carefully. To any observer, human or otherwise, he would appear to be doing exactly what his father expected—carefully studying the family's most precious secrets.

But while he performed this charade, his mind was already processing the chip's analysis. The breathing method was indeed sophisticated, describing techniques for drawing vitality not just from the body's natural processes but from consumed food, absorbed sunlight, and even ambient life energy present in the environment.

The missing portions were clearly advanced applications—methods for accelerating the cultivation process or techniques for combining vitality with physical movements for enhanced combat effectiveness. Without those sections, the method was powerful but incomplete, like a sword with a missing edge.

As he read, Morvain became increasingly aware of the presence watching him. It didn't feel malevolent, exactly, but it was definitely not human. Something ancient and patient, as if it had been waiting in this study for decades or even centuries.

The sensation grew stronger near the hidden compartment, suggesting that whatever observed him was connected to the other four books resting in their concealed alcove. His father had mentioned that House Malaroth had collected these methods over generations—who knew what else might have been acquired along with the books themselves?

Time passed slowly in the study's oppressive atmosphere. Outside, he could hear the distant sounds of castle life continuing—guards changing shifts, servants going about their duties, the normal rhythm of a great household. But within these walls, surrounded by ancient knowledge and watched by unseen eyes, Morvain felt completely removed from that mundane world.

When he finally closed the book, several hours had passed. The afternoon sun slanted through the study's narrow windows, casting long shadows that seemed to dance with independent purpose. He had read through the entire method twice, cementing both the chip's analysis and his own understanding of what lay ahead.

Tomorrow, his father would depart to gather the materials needed for the dangerous acceleration process. And when that happened, Morvain would return to this study with a very different purpose in mind.

The chip had identified the Malaroth method as incomplete, requiring additional techniques for proper analysis. Fortunately, four other breathing methods waited just a few feet away, and his father would be gone for days.

He carefully returned the crimson tome to its pedestal and activated the hidden mechanism to seal the compartment. As the stone wall slid back into place, Morvain felt the watching presence withdraw slightly, as if it too understood that this was merely the beginning.

"Until tomorrow," he whispered to the empty study, then made his way back through the castle corridors.

Tonight, he would plan. Tomorrow, when his father departed for whatever distant location held the materials he needed, Morvain would return to claim the knowledge that could complete his family's inheritance.

The thought both thrilled and terrified him, but he had long since committed to the path of risk and reward. In this world of knights and hidden powers, caution was a luxury he couldn't afford.

The game was about to begin in earnest.
