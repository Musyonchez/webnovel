Chapter 1: Awakening

The first thing Morvain noticed wasn't the unfamiliar ceiling above him, nor the medieval stone walls that replaced his modern apartment. It was the silence where his phone's notification sounds should have been.

Then came the pain.

A dull, throbbing ache at the back of his skull that seemed to pulse with each heartbeat. He tried to lift his hand to touch the source, but his arm felt wrong—too thin, too pale, the calluses he'd earned from years of laboratory work nowhere to be found.

The text appeared in his vision like a holographic display, stark blue letters floating in the corner of his sight. His breath caught. The neural interface chip—the breakthrough technology that had revolutionized human cognition in his world—was still active.

"What the hell?" he whispered, then froze. Even his voice was different—younger, with an accent he didn't recognize.

[ACCESSING HOST MEMORIES...]

The door creaked open, and a young woman entered carrying a wooden basin and clean linens. She couldn't have been older than sixteen, with mousy brown hair and calloused hands that spoke of hard labor. When she saw him sitting up, her face lit up with relief.

"Young Master Morvain! You're awake!" She set the basin down and hurried to his side. "Your father will be so relieved. We feared... after the injury..."

The memories hit him like a flood. Not his memories—Morvain Malaroth's memories. The assassination attempt three days ago. A figure in black appearing from the shadows as young Morvain walked through the castle gardens. The sickening crack of something hard striking the back of his skull. The assassin's body found hours later, killed by Baron Aldric Malaroth's own blade, but no identification, no clue who had sent him.

The original Morvain had died from that blow. Somehow, impossibly, a consciousness from another world had taken his place.

"I'm... I'm fine, Mira," he said, the name coming naturally from the borrowed memories. "Just tired."

Mira's relief was palpable. "Let me help you wash, Young Master. Your father has been training in the courtyard, but I know he'll want to see you."

As she prepared the bath, Morvain—he would keep the name, he decided—tested the chip's functions. Memory access was perfect, though now it contained the experiences of two different lives. Analytical processing remained sharp. The optimization protocols that had made him a successful researcher in his previous life were still active.

But this world was different. These memories spoke of knights and mysterious figures called wizards, of a kingdom called Ashenwald where strength determined status and magic was both feared and revered.

After Mira helped him wash and dress, Morvain made his way through the castle halls to the courtyard. The stone corridors were lit by torches rather than electric lights, and servants bowed as he passed—a level of deference his previous life had never known.

The courtyard training ground spread before him like an arena. Two dozen men in leather and mail moved through combat drills, their bodies flowing in patterns that seemed almost like dance. But it was more than mere swordplay.

Morvain's eyes widened. The chip was detecting something extraordinary. These weren't just physical exercises—there was something else, some additional element that enhanced their movements beyond normal human capability.

"Chip, record all observable data," he subvocalized.

[RECORDING INITIATED]

Near the far end of the courtyard, two figures stood apart from the others. One was a mountain of a man with graying hair and a scar running from his left temple to his jaw—Baron Aldric Malaroth, his father in this life. The other was nearly as large, wearing the insignia of a senior knight.

When the chip scanned them, the readings intensified dramatically.

Whatever these knights were doing, the senior ones possessed far more of it than the common soldiers. The difference was like comparing a candle to a bonfire.

Baron Aldric noticed him watching and gestured for the senior knight to continue training the others. As his father approached, Morvain noted the way the man moved—fluid, controlled, with an economy of motion that spoke of deadly efficiency.

"Morvain." His father's voice was gruff but held genuine concern. "How do you feel? The healer said the blow might have affected your mind."

"I feel fine, Father. Different, perhaps, but not... damaged."

Aldric studied his face intently. In the borrowed memories, the original Morvain had been bookish, preferring scrolls and histories to combat training. This sudden interest in military exercises would seem strange.

"You're watching the training," Aldric observed.

"Yes. It's fascinating. I never really noticed before how... complex it is."

Something shifted in his father's expression. Perhaps it was hope, or maybe just surprise. "Would you like to learn?"

The question hung in the air between them. In his previous life, Morvain had been a researcher, not a warrior. But this world operated on different rules, and the chip had detected something worth studying in these techniques.

"Yes," he said simply.

Aldric's eyebrows rose. The original Morvain had never shown any interest in knightly pursuits. "The injury seems to have sparked something in you. Very well. Come."

He led Morvain to a smaller, private training area behind the main courtyard. Here, another senior knight was practicing forms with a training sword. He was lean where Aldric was broad, but the chip detected the same elevated energy signatures.

"Sir Garrett," Aldric called. "My son wishes to begin knight training."

The knight—Sir Garrett—approached and bowed slightly. "My lord. Young master." His weathered face showed polite surprise. "I will do my best to instruct him."

"See that you do. Start with the fundamentals." Aldric clasped Morvain's shoulder. "I have other duties, but Sir Garrett will see to your initial training."

After his father departed, Sir Garrett gestured for Morvain to stand in the center of the small yard.

"We begin with the First Stance," Garrett said, moving into position. "Foundation of all that follows. Watch carefully."

The knight's body shifted into what looked like a simple standing position, but the chip immediately detected the subtleties—micro-adjustments in muscle tension, breathing patterns, the distribution of weight. It was far more complex than it appeared.

"Now you try," Garrett instructed.

Morvain attempted to copy the stance. His muscles felt awkward, unpracticed, and within seconds he knew he was doing it wrong.

"Chip, scan Sir Garrett's form and provide postural corrections," he thought.

[IMPLEMENTING REAL-TIME POSTURAL GUIDANCE]

Suddenly, it was as if invisible hands were adjusting his position. His spine straightened, his weight shifted, his breathing deepened. The awkward stance transformed into something that felt natural, centered.

Sir Garrett's eyes widened. "Remarkable. In thirty years of training knights, I've never seen anyone correct their form so quickly." He moved into a different stance. "Try this one."

Again, Morvain started poorly, then the chip's guidance kicked in, and his body found the proper alignment with startling speed.

"Extraordinary," Garrett murmured. "A third stance, then."

The pattern repeated. By the fourth stance, Morvain's legs were trembling with fatigue, and sweat ran down his back despite the cool morning air. When Garrett demonstrated the fifth form, Morvain's body simply gave out. He collapsed to his knees, gasping.

"Enough for now," Garrett said, not unkindly. "Your mind learns quickly, but your body needs time to adapt." He called to a servant. "Bring food and water for the young master."

As the knight returned to his own training, Morvain remained on the ground, too exhausted to stand. But his mind was still active.

"Chip, continue recording Sir Garrett's movements. Full analysis."

[RECORDING CONTINUES... BUILDING MOVEMENT DATABASE]

When the food arrived—bread, cheese, and watered wine—Morvain ate mechanically while watching the knight's solo practice. The chip catalogued every motion, every breathing pattern, every subtle shift in the mysterious energy that enhanced their capabilities.

After ten minutes of rest, the fatigue faded enough for him to stand. His muscles still ached, but it was manageable.

"Sir Garrett," he called. "Could we try the first stance again?"

The knight paused in his exercises, looking surprised. "Are you certain? Most novices need a full day to recover from their first session."

"I'm certain."

This time, Morvain's initial attempt was closer to correct—the chip had learned from the previous session and could guide him more efficiently. His second attempt was nearly perfect.

They continued for another hour before exhaustion claimed him again. Food, rest, then back to training. The cycle repeated throughout the day.

By evening, Morvain could hold the first three stances for several minutes before his muscles gave out. Sir Garrett's amazement had given way to intense curiosity.

"I've never seen learning like this," the knight admitted as the sun set. "It's as if you can see the mistakes in your form and correct them instantly."

If only he knew, Morvain thought.

The pattern continued for three days. Each morning, he would find Sir Garrett in the private yard, and they would train until Morvain collapsed. Food and brief rest, then more training. The chip recorded everything, building an ever-more-detailed database of knightly techniques.

By the third day, Morvain could complete all five basic stances without collapsing, though the effort still left him drained. More importantly, he was beginning to sense something—a warmth in his chest that seemed to respond to the movements, growing stronger with each session.

[ENERGY SIGNATURE DETECTED IN HOST]
[ANALYZING... CLASSIFICATION: UNKNOWN]
[RECOMMENDATION: CONTINUE OBSERVATION]

Whatever the knights called their enhancement method, he was beginning to develop it himself. The chip couldn't identify it yet, but it was definitely there—a spark of something that made his movements more fluid, his balance more stable.

As the third day's training ended and he sat in the courtyard watching the senior knights drill, Morvain felt a deep satisfaction. In three days, he had learned more about this world's physical enhancement than the original Morvain had absorbed in sixteen years of life.

But this was just the beginning. If knights possessed such abilities, what could the wizards do? The borrowed memories spoke of them in hushed tones—beings who lived for centuries, who could level cities with their will, who demanded tribute from kingdoms.

The chip had given him the means to learn and adapt faster than anyone in this world could imagine. Now he needed to decide how to use that advantage.

One thing was certain: he would not remain content with the limitations of a minor baron's son. This world had power to offer, and he intended to claim it.

All of it.
