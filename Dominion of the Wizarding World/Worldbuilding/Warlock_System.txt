WARLOCK WIZARD SYSTEM - Dominion of the Wizarding World

CONCEPT:
Instead of body modification, wizards can bond with creature essences through ritual absorption of vital components (heart, horn, venom gland, feathers, etc.)

ABSORPTION MECHANICS:
- Ritual requires vital organs/components from target creature
- Wizard channels mana + engraving spells to bind essence into their body
- Partial form: safer, lower power, brief duration, low corruption
- Full form: prolonged, high power, intense mana draw, high risk

CREATURE LEVELS & LIMITS:
- Every creature has a tier (1-9), not tied to age alone
- Even newborn unicorns/dragons cannot be Level 1
- Wizard's max rank cannot exceed level of absorbed creature
- Higher-tier wizards can absorb creatures closer to their rank

CREATURE WILL & CORRUPTION:
- Every creature has a will that fights for dominance
- Weak wizards may lose control → mindless killing machine or permanent corruption
- Conflicting creatures (fire + water, predator + prey) → drastically reduced success
- First creature success ~50%, adding conflicting second ~15% or lower

REMOVAL/SWAPPING RULES:
- Rank 1-2: Theoretically possible but extremely risky (15-50% success)
- Rank 3+: Creature essence fully integrated → removal literally impossible
- Any attempt at Rank 3+ → instant death (bones, ash, corruption)
- Makes early choices permanent and high-stakes

TRANSFORMATION SCALING:
- Rank 1: Seconds, clumsy, partial form only
- Rank 3: Minutes, more stable control
- Rank 6: Hours, tactical mastery
- Rank 9: Battlefield-scale transformations, near-perfect control

MC'S CHIMERA CHOICE:
- Chimera = amalgamation of multiple creatures (3-5 species)
- Multiple conflicting wills normally impossible to control
- MC's AI chip coordinates/harmonizes the wills
- Explains why no other wizard attempts Chimera bonding

SUGGESTED MC CHIMERA COMPOSITION:
1. Predatory Feline (Tiger/Panther) → speed, claws, reflexes, predatory instincts
2. Reptilian Serpent (Venomous Snake/Basilisk) → fangs, poison glands, constriction, jaw flexibility
3. Insectoid/Arthropod (Scorpion/Giant Wasp) → exoskeletal plates, tail/stinger, minor swarm connection

ORIGIN STORY:
- At Rank 3, MC encounters another apprentice who created first Chimera spell
- Original creator already mentally unstable from conflicting wills (feline + serpent)
- MC defeats and kills the broken apprentice, takes the spell
- Learns from the failure, uses AI chip to solve the multi-will problem

PROGRESSION:
- Rank 1-3: Partial features (claws, fangs, small exoskeletal growth)
- Rank 4-6: More pronounced (elongated claws, chest maw, armored limbs, functional tail)
- Rank 7-9: Full body-horror abomination with all creature traits integrated
