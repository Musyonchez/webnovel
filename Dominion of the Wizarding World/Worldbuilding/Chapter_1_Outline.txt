CHAPTER 1 OUTLINE - Dominion of the Wizarding World

CHAPTER GOAL: Establish transmigration, AI chip, knight world basics, family dynamic

SCENE 1: THE DEATH (Earth) [800-1000 words]
- Brief: MC dies in modern world (keep vague - overwork, accident, obsession with knowledge)
- Tone: Quick, clinical, no sentimentality
- Focus: The moment of death, darkness, then transition

SCENE 2: THE AWAKENING (Fantasy World) [1000-1200 words]
- MC jolts awake in unfamiliar body
- Disorientation: different hands, different room, medieval setting
- Realizes: "This isn't my world"
- Physical differences: Morvain's body vs his original

SCENE 3: AI CHIP ACTIVATION [800-1000 words]
- Cold, mechanical voice in his head
- Chip provides analysis: "New neural patterns detected. Transmigration confirmed"
- MC tests basic functions: memory access, calculation, optimization
- Key limitation: chip enhances learning but can't create knowledge
- MC whispers: "So I kept my ace in the hole"

SCENE 4: FAMILY DISCOVERY [1000-1200 words]
- Servant enters, addresses him as "Young Master Morvain"
- MC learns he's part of House Malaroth (noble knight family)
- Father enters: stern, scarred, traditional knight bearing
- Tension: father notices MC acting "strange" but attributes to illness
- Subtle hints about family's "cursed" reputation

SCENE 5: WORLD INFORMATION GATHERING [1000-1200 words]
- MC carefully questions family about basic world info
- Learns: knights train body/aura, wizards exist but are feared/respected
- Father mentions wizards live apart: "radiation kills normal folk"
- Seeds planted: knights are limited, wizards transcend mortality
- House Malaroth's resistance to disease/poison mentioned

SCENE 6: FIRST TRAINING CALL [800-1000 words]
- Father summons MC to training yard
- MC must prove he's "recovered" from his "illness"
- Setup for next chapter: knight abilities + AI chip optimization
- End hook: "Show me you're still my son, Morvain"
- MC's internal resolve: survive and rise, no matter the system

WRITING NOTES:
- Keep transmigration explanation minimal - focus on action
- AI chip should sound robotic/clinical vs MC's human thoughts
- Show House Malaroth's reputation through dialogue, not exposition
- Foreshadow wizard world without explaining everything
- End each scene with a hook/question to pull reader forward
- Target: 5,000-6,500 words total for Chapter 1

KEY THEMES TO ESTABLISH:
- MC's cold pragmatism vs knight honor culture
- AI chip as analytical tool, not magic solution
- House Malaroth's dark reputation and plague resistance
- Knight limitations vs wizard transcendence
- Family dynamics: love but also wariness

CHAPTER 1 ENDS WITH:
MC accepting the challenge to prove himself, internally planning to optimize knight training while secretly knowing his true goal lies beyond the knight path entirely.
