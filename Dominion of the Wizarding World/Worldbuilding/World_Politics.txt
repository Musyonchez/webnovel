WORLD POLITICS - Dominion of the Wizarding World

THE WIZARDING WORLD HIERARCHY:

RANK 7-9 WIZARDS:
- Off-world fighting gods, creating civilizations, waging cosmic wars
- Basically mythical figures to lower ranks
- Their radiation prevents them from staying on planet long-term
- Rank 7: Weakest, act as convoy escorts for void campaigns
- Rank 8-9: Rarely involved unless world-will creates Rank 8-9 champions

THE COUNCIL (Ranks 4-6):
- True rulers of the wizarding world
- Manage campaigns, resource allocation, school politics
- Each rank jump (1-3 → 4-6 → 7-9) is like changing species
- Assign Rank 7 escorts to void expeditions
- Enforce tribute system: Rank 7s get 30-50% of all spoils

SCHOOLS/ACADEMIES:
- Foundation of wizard world, both learning centers and military orders
- Without school support, Rank 1-3 wizards cannot survive
- Provide: potions, mana stones, protective wards, knowledge access
- Teachers are mostly Rank 1-3 wizards (burned-out veterans)
- Schools rise and fall based on campaign success

APPRENTICES (Rank 0-3):
- Forbidden from leaving planet by Council decree
- Schools act as training grounds and filtering mechanisms
- High mortality rate during training and campaigns
- "Survival of the fittest" philosophy - no mercy for weak

VOID CAMPAIGNS:

STRUCTURE:
- Rank 4-6 wizards plan invasions and gather armies
- Council assigns Rank 7 escorts (mandatory for void travel)
- Armies composed of Rank 1-3 volunteers
- Apprentices cannot participate (Council law)

ECONOMICS:
- Volunteer system: spoils belong to commanding wizard
- Rank 7 escort gets 30-50% tribute (Council enforced)
- Schools get shares for providing volunteers
- Conscription only in dire emergencies

WORLD MECHANICS:
- Every world has a "Will" (childlike but powerful)
- Will empowers natives when invaded (can create Rank 6-7 champions)
- Rank 7s must "break" the world's will for invasion to succeed
- Void is dangerous: creatures, spatial traps, predators

KNIGHT SOCIETY:

RELATIONSHIP TO WIZARDS:
- Knights are "failed experiments" - powerful but limited
- Originally created as fast-production soldiers for wizard wars
- Mana-poor lands: Knights flourish, wizards avoid
- Mana-rich lands: Knights are glorified slaves

HIERARCHY:
- Noble houses maintain prestige but serve wizard interests
- Common knights work as guards, enforcers, cannon fodder
- Mind control spells (Rank 2+) make resistance impossible
- Some knight kingdoms exist in mana-barren wastelands

LAWS AND PHILOSOPHY:

"FITTEST SURVIVE":
- Wizards believe only strength deserves to exist
- Schools tolerate internal cruelty (assassinations, duels, sabotage)
- Campaign failures = natural culling of weak schools
- No room for mercy - seen as weakness

BLACK VS WHITE WIZARDS:
- "White wizards" are propaganda/myth
- All wizards pursue knowledge without moral limits
- Difference: some mask their cruelty (White), others embrace it (Black)
- Both are equally damned and dangerous

RADIATION AND ISOLATION:
- Wizard radiation kills normal humans
- Forces physical separation from "lesser beings"
- Reinforces cultural elitism and detachment
- Creates floating cities, isolated towers, pocket realms

COSMIC PERSPECTIVE:
- Wizarding world sees itself as center of universe
- Other worlds are resources to harvest or conquer
- Morality is weakness, knowledge is power
- Ultimate goal: transcend universe itself (Rank 10+)
